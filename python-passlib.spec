%description
Passlib is a password hashing library for Python 2 & 3, which provides
cross-platform implementations of over 20 password hashing algorithms,
as well as a framework for managing existing password hashes. It is
designed to be useful for a wide range of tasks, from verifying a hash
found in /etc/shadow, to providing full-strength password hashing for
multi-user application.
